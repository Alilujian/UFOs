# UFOs

### Overview
From this project, we are building a HTML webpage to show information from a javascript data file. Using filters in the webpage will allow us to pull up information of UFO sightings from different area of US.

The openning paragraph in the top of the page will introduce basic information of the UFO sighting facts. At the bottom of the page, there will be our filters and table. In the left side as shown in figure 2, there are 5 different filters can be used to pull up information. As changing the filters, the information will pull up in the table as shown in figure 3.

### Summary
We have create a website allow user to choose different information based on the filters. However, there is no clear button allow user to clear out the filters at one click. When user want to see different results, they need to clear the filters one by one, which is time consuming. In future developing, we can create the clear button, so that filters can be clear by one click. In addition, the data we showed in the table are not clean enough. The comment section contain a lot of weird sign. It is better to clean the dataset so that user can understand the content.
